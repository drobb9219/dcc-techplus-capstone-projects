# ðŸ“‹ Week 1: Team Project Planning & Leadership

## Objective:
Learn and apply core project management principles to structure and manage a 6-week cohort experience. Week 1 emphasized defining project goals, establishing team roles, and creating a collaborative execution plan for future deliverables.

## My Role:
Although documentation wasnâ€™t formally submitted, I played a key role in **leading a team of 8 cohort members** through portions of the planning and project execution process.

This involved:
- Facilitating communication and scheduling across time zones
- Breaking down assignments into task lists and team deliverables
- Ensuring our group remained aligned on weekly expectations and timelines
- Taking ownership of clarity, accountability, and direction for our work

## Framework We Followed:
We used project management best practices including:
1. **Defining scope & deliverables**
2. **Breaking tasks into milestones**
3. **Assigning responsibilities** based on skill and bandwidth
4. **Creating visual timelines** to track weekly outputs
5. **Reviewing & adapting** based on group performance

## Skills Demonstrated:
- âœ… Project Management Fundamentals (scope, schedule, delegation)
- âœ… Cross-functional team leadership
- âœ… Communication and time management
- âœ… Initiative in fast-paced, collaborative environments

## Outcome:
Week 1 set the tone for a highly organized and collaborative cohort. The planning process we established helped the team deliver on subsequent projects with focus and cohesion.

> ðŸ§  This was more than an academic exercise â€” it was hands-on **PM experience in action.**
